Code repository for the workflow presented in the article "A neural network super-resolution approach for the reconstruction of coastal sea states"
(J. Kuehn, S. Abadie, V. Roeber, 2022).

It contains the SWAN script files that were used to produce the low- and high-resolution results. The pre-processing of the data and the training
of the neural network are done with Python and are saved as Jupyter Notebooks.
